# Sentiment Analysis Project â€“ Training Cum Internship on Data Science, AI & ML
This project was undertaken as part of a Training cum Internship on Data Science, AI, and ML, conducted by Ardent Computech Pvt. Ltd., Kolkata, from 4th July 2024 to 4th August 2024. During this one-month program, I gained comprehensive knowledge of Machine Learning (ML) concepts and was introduced to the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing (NLP), which were crucial for completing this project on Sentiment Analysis.

### Project Overview
The primary objective of this project was to perform sentiment analysis on a chat dataset to classify the sentiments of messages into three categories:

i) Positive

ii) Neutral

iii) Negative

Using NLP techniques and implementing classification-based ML models, I analyzed the dataset to extract and predict the underlying sentiments of chat messages. The process involved several key steps, such as data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

### Learning Outcomes
This project allowed me to apply the theoretical knowledge gained during the training to solve a practical problem in NLP. Specifically, I learned about:

i) Data Preprocessing: Techniques for cleaning and preparing unstructured text data for analysis.

ii) Feature Extraction: Using methods like TF-IDF to convert text into numerical representations.

iii) ML Models for Classification: Training and deploying models like Logistic Regression, Support Vector, and Naive Bayes for sentiment classification.

iv) Model Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of the models.

### Mentorship and Guidance
This project was completed under the guidance of Mr. Joyjit Guha Biswas, Project Manager at Ardent Computech Pvt. Ltd., whose mentorship was invaluable in understanding the nuances of NLP and applying them effectively.

### Conclusion
This experience provided a hands-on understanding of sentiment analysis using NLP techniques and machine learning models. It helped me bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, and it reinforced the importance of data-driven solutions in analyzing and interpreting textual data.

All the details of the project, including dataset preprocessing, model implementation, results, and findings, are documented in this repository.
