## Sentiment Analysis Project 😃

This project was completed as part of a Data Science, AI, and ML Training cum Internship program at Ardent Computech Pvt. Ltd., Kolkata, from July 4th, 2024, to August 4th, 2024. 🗓️ The program provided comprehensive training in Machine Learning (ML) 🤖 and an introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) 🗣️, which were essential for this sentiment analysis project.

### Project Overview

This project focused on sentiment analysis of a chat dataset 💬, classifying message sentiment into three categories: positive 👍, neutral 😐, and negative 👎. Using NLP techniques and classification-based ML models, the project aimed to analyze and predict the sentiment expressed in chat messages. The process included data preprocessing 🧹, feature extraction ⚙️, model training 🏋️, and evaluation 📈.

### Learning Outcomes

This project provided practical experience applying theoretical knowledge gained during the training program to a real-world NLP problem. Key learning outcomes include:

*   **Data Preprocessing:** Techniques for cleaning and preparing unstructured text data for analysis. 🧼
*   **Feature Extraction:** Methods like TF-IDF for converting text into numerical representations suitable for ML models. 🔢
*   **ML Models for Classification:** Training and deploying models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Naive Bayes for sentiment classification. 🤖
*   **Model Evaluation:** Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance. 📊

### Mentorship and Guidance

The project was completed under the mentorship of Mr. Joyjit Guha Biswas, Project Manager at Ardent Computech Pvt. Ltd. His guidance was invaluable in understanding and effectively applying NLP principles. 🙏

### Conclusion

This internship provided hands-on experience in sentiment analysis using NLP and machine learning. It bridged the gap between theory and practice, demonstrating the importance of data-driven solutions for analyzing and interpreting textual data. 💡
